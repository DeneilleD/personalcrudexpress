## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDb

I utilized my skills in javaScript, HTML and CSS to capture an inviting application for users. I also utilized Mongo.Db and Node.js to serve up information to a user after they send a request to my server. I am able to view and manipulate(delete) users information as they provide it.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned to how to use event listeners and APIs to send a response which will be served up to a user using an ejs template file!
